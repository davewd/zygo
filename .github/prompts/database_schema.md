I'm building my database schema using Firebase and collections, aiming for a scalable and efficient design. I want to create a top-level 'actor' collection that branches out into more specialized collections (e.g., educators, service providers, community members). Considering various features like comments/likes, FeedListItems, and tool-specific data, please help me:

Identify the key entities (collections) for each actor type.
Design the schema structure for each collection, including fields and relationships between them.
Consider how to efficiently store and retrieve data, especially with regards to commenting/liking, feed items, and tool-specific data.
Please provide a code snippet in Python (as I assume that's the preferred language), referencing the relevant Firebase Firestore documentation where applicable.

When suggesting modifications, you can use placeholders for unmodified sections, as per our guidelines.
