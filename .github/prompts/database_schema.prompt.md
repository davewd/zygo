I'm building my database schema using Firebase and collections, aiming for a scalable and efficient design. I want to create a top-level 'actor' collection that branches out into more specialized collections (e.g., educators, service providers, community members). Considering various features like comments/likes, FeedListItems, and tool-specific data in their own right. Please help me:

- Identify the key entities (collections) for each actor type.
- Design the schema structure for each collection, including fields and relationships between them.
- Consider how to efficiently store and retrieve data, especially with regards to commenting/liking, feed items, and tool-specific data.
- Please prodive a mermaid diagram so I can see the schema in a visual format.

If you want to suggest modifitcations that owuld be fgnatastic, please give me a detailed, bullet pointed reason for each proposal but include them in your response.  Ideally you would immediatly respond with the diagram unless oyu need clarification
